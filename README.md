## How to run the script
The best and easiest way to run the script is by using an IDEA like IntelliJ. You need at least OpenJDK-8 installed on your Computer.
If you dont have IntelliJ installed you can run the script by passing the following command line into a CLI tool of your choice.

### How to run the script form the command line
1. switch into the src folder of the checked out project and open a CLI Tool of your choice
2. execute "javac Main" in the Command Line
3. after that execute "java Main" in the same command line and enjoy the results. 

## What would be further steps
The order of the following steps arent the order they should be implement in.
1. Add a good logging
2. Maybe wrap everything in Gradle and build an executable for e.g. Windows
3. Add GitHub Actions for automatic testing
4. Make it possible to pass your own "poker"-hands easily
5. Add execption Handling
